This is a notebook comparing two methods of estimating effective population size (Ne). 




The methods are described in detail in Wang (2009) and Waples (2011):

* Wang, Jinliang. "A new method for estimating effective population sizes from a single sample of multilocus genotypes." Molecular Ecology 18.10 (2009): 2148-2164.

* Waples, Robin S., and Ryan K. Waples. "Inbreeding effective population size and parentage analysis without parents." Molecular ecology resources 11.s1 (2011): 162-171.
